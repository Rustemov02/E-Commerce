 Hi guys !
 
 I created an online shopping website using ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI. It helps you to group products into categories and add them to your cart. The site works well on small screens too, and you can change the color scheme to a darker theme.
 
 You can access my site here : commerce02.netlify.com
